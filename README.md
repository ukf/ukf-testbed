# `ukf-testbed`

This repository contains a framework used to perform tests on the
UK federation's tooling, specifically those parts which validate
SAML metadata before publication.

The testbed operates as a collection of Docker containers established by
`docker compose`. A `driver` service is initially idle and is used to
run test operations, or can be used interactively. It is accompanied
by a fleet of validator containers each with a different configuration;
each of these is a variation of the `md-validator` microservice.

The containers operate within a private network but are otherwise isolated
from each other and from the host. The exception is the `driver` service,
which mounts the host `tests` directory as `/application/tests` to allow
development of individual tests without needing to rebuild the containers.

Build the container images using `./build-images`.

Establish the running containers using `./up`; remove them using `./down`.

Executing `./drive` will open a `bash` shell within the `driver` service
in which test operations can be performed.

Remember that it may take a while for the validator containers to fully initialise,
and you may not be able to execute commands against them immediately on starting `./drive`.
On my desktop machine, 20 seconds or so is required.

If you want a less interactive experience, you can just invoke commands
within the `driver` container directly, for example:

```bash
docker compose exec driver rake validate_all
```

Output from the command will appear in your terminal.

## Development Mode

The validator fleet has one distinguished member representing the current
production deployment, currently `v09x`. This validator's port 8080 is
bound to `localhost:8080` as well as being available within the
`docker compose` internal network.

The `Testbed.all_endpoints` function examines the `RAILS_ENV` environmental variable
to determine which validators are available:

- Inside the `driver` service (where `RAILS_ENV` is set to `production`),
  `all_endpoints` returns an array of all available endpoints so that the
  same operation can be performed against each validator in turn.
- Outside the `driver` service (e.g., on the host) `all_endpoints` returns
  a singleton endpoint for `localhost:8080` which accesses the `v09x`
  container alone.

This arrangement allows the test framework itself to be developed
without having to rebuild the `driver` image for each change.

## Test Setup

Individual unit tests are added to suitable subdirectories of `/tests/`. Each 'type' of unit test *should* go into its own subdirectory (or subdirectory hierarchy), for example, XML tests inside `/tests/xml/`. Tests can be executed against the fleet of validators by running the command `rake validate_all` inside the `driver` service. 
### XML Test Setup

Unit tests that take XML elements (e.g. an EntityDescriptor) need to be placed in the `/tests/xml` directory and have a `.xml` file extension. Running `rake validate_all` from the `driver` service will process all test files using the `xml_tests.rb` module against the `default` validator fleet. The validators to run can be configured via a sidecar YAML file (see Individual Test Configuration). 

### Individual Test Configuration

The execution options and the expected outcome of individual tests can be configured in a sidecar YAML file. The YAML file needs the same name as and must be co-located with, the test. For example:

``` bash
/tests/<type>/<test-name>.<ext>
/tests/<type>/<test-name>.yaml
```

The YAML file can configure the following test options:
 - The `expected` result of the test. This includes:
   - The result `status`, which is one-of, `error`, `info`, or `warning`.
   - The `component_id` of the component that generated the result. 
   - The result description `message`.
 - Which `validators` to run. If none are specified, the `default` validator is used.

An example sidecar YAML options file is show below:

``` yaml
expected:
  - status: error
    component_id: component_identifier
    message: "expected error message"
validators:
  - validator_1
  - validator_2
```

If a validator produces an "error", "info", or "warning" result for a given test that is not described by that test's `expected` configuration option, the test will fail. The actual result and expected result are equal if the String value of their `status`, `component_id`, and `message` match exactly.
